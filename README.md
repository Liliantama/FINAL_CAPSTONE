# FINAL_CAPSTONE

# MOVIE_RECOMENDATION_APP

# Problem_statement:
In todayâ€™s digital era, consumers have access to an overwhelming number of movies across various platforms. As streaming services and online databases expand, users often find it difficult to discover movies that align with their personal tastes. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of personalized recommendations, leaving users frustrated and wasting time searching for content that resonates with them. 

# Solution:
This capstone project aims to build a personalized movie recommendation app that leverages user data and machine learning algorithms to provide tailored movie suggestions. By analyzing user preferences, viewing history, ratings, and genre inclinations, the app will recommend movies that align more accurately with their interests. This will not only enhance the user experience by minimizing search time but also expose them to lesser-known films that they might enjoy, creating a more enjoyable and diverse movie-watching journey. The app will address the gap in personalized content discovery, ultimately solving the challenge of movie recommendation fatigue.
